        <h2>Conflicts</h2>
        <br>
        Water scarcity leads to conflicts between nations and states. Many examples exist, such as the Grand Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia. The dam is located on the Nile River. Egypt disapproves of this dam as the Nile is its main water source, and if the Nile is dammed, their water supplies would be much lower. As a result, the relations between Ethiopia and Egypt have gotten much, much worse. There are many more examples of this, such as between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, China, India and Bangladesh.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>diseases and health effects</h2>
        <br>
        Water scarcity leads to a lack of clean drinking water, which spreads diseases and has other adverse health effects. It also increases unhygienic practices. Farmers can resort to using untreated water to water crops, which causes the spread of disease through tainted food. 
        Water scarcity also leads to an increase in vector-borne diseases caused by animals like flies, mosquitoes and ticks. Still water bodies and lower amounts of predators are effects of water scarcity, so the population of such animals greatly increases, and so do diseases caused by them. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>food insecurity</h2>
        <br>
        Water scarcity leads to lower crop yields, increases the cost of food and hardships for farmers. The increase in food prices often results in families of lower incomes having to skip meals, causing malnutrition. Malnutrition in children can lead to underdevelopment and leads to poor performance in school, and therefore fewer career opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Stunted growth also leads to a weak immune system and makes them more prone to diseases and infections. 
        <br>
        <br>
       <h2>Economic effects</h2>
        <br>
        Water scarcity has a massive impact on agriculture, industry, energy, and the economies of countries and regions. Agriculture, apparel, beverages, pharmaceuticals, tech, mining, and electric power are all very water-intensive industries and rely on water as a resource. For example, to make a silicon chip, the kind in our phones, tablets, and laptops, billions of gallons of water are used to rinse and clean them. For just one chip, approximately 30,000 litres of water are used. So a lack of water can impact manufacturing, profit and products of companies and local economies.

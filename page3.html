        <h2>How the government prevents future shortages of water</h2>
        Chennai is very dependent on rainwater and the monsoon season. The reason for the 2019 crisis was a deficit of
        rainfall in 2018. To stop future shortages of water, proper storage is necessary, as areas with storage were
        less affected than those without. Another area that will help prevent water shortage is rainwater harvesting.
        NGOS such as Raincenter Chennai are helping buildings build and maintain rainwater harvesting systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        The responsible use of water is also necessary to prevent shortages. Policies such as the metering policy have
        been introduced to bill water use like electricity. It aims to make corporations more responsible for their
        water usage. Water recycling is also being promoted, it aims to reuse water from sinks and use it for toilet
        flushing or industrial use.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chennai has also diversified the sources of water it uses. The government has made new desalination plants,
        basin-to-basin water transport, rainwater harvesting, and more. This aims to reduce Chennai‚Äôs dependence on
        rainfall.

        <h2>How you can prevent future shortages of water</h2>
        There are plenty ways you can conserve water at home.
        <ul>
            <li>Turn off taps when not in use (like while brushing teeth).</li>
            <li>Fix leaking pipes and faucets quickly.</li>
            <li>look for appliances with good water efficiency ratings.</li>
            <li>Collect and reuse rainwater for gardening.</li>
            <li>Install aerators in sinks to reduce water flow</li>
            <li>Advocate for rainwater harvesting and storage in homes</li>
            <li>Do not buy pools or tubs</li>
          <li>Fix leaks promptly ‚Äì A dripping faucet or leaky toilet can waste gallons of water daily.</li>
  <li>Install low-flow showerheads ‚Äì These reduce water use without sacrificing water pressure.</li>
  <li>Turn off the tap while brushing teeth ‚Äì This can save up to 8 gallons of water per day.</li>
  <li>Use a dishwasher instead of handwashing ‚Äì Modern dishwashers use less water than handwashing.</li>
  <li>Only run full loads ‚Äì Whether it's the dishwasher or washing machine, running full loads maximizes water efficiency.</li>
  <li>Collect rainwater for gardening ‚Äì Use barrels or containers to capture rainwater for outdoor use.</li>
  <li>Use a broom instead of a hose ‚Äì Clean driveways and sidewalks with a broom instead of water.</li>
  <li>Water plants early or late in the day ‚Äì This reduces water loss due to evaporation.</li>
  <li>Use drought-resistant plants ‚Äì Landscaping with native or drought-tolerant plants reduces watering needs.</li>
  <li>Install dual-flush or low-flow toilets ‚Äì These use significantly less water per flush.</li>
  <li>Insulate water pipes ‚Äì Hot water arrives faster, reducing water wasted while waiting for it to heat up.</li>
  <li>Shorten showers ‚Äì Cutting even 2 minutes off a shower can save hundreds of gallons per month.</li>
  <li>Place a bucket in the shower ‚Äì Catch water as it warms up and use it for plants.</li>
  <li>Upgrade to water-efficient appliances ‚Äì Look for WaterSense-labeled fixtures and ENERGY STAR appliances.</li>
  <li>Mulch your garden ‚Äì Mulch retains soil moisture and reduces the need for frequent watering.</li>
  <li>Don't overwater lawns ‚Äì Water only when necessary and according to the season.</li>
  <li>Cover pools to reduce evaporation ‚Äì Pool covers can save thousands of gallons each year.</li>
  <li>Use a nozzle on your garden hose ‚Äì A shut-off nozzle controls water flow and avoids waste.</li>
  <li>Check water meter for hidden leaks ‚Äì Monitoring your meter can reveal unnoticed water loss.</li>
  <li>Educate household members ‚Äì Encourage everyone to be mindful about water use.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>what is it?</h2>
        <br>
        The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan and brokered by the World Bank, is a water-sharing agreement concerning the Indus River system. It allocates the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) to India and the three western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) to Pakistan. Despite tensions between the two nations, the treaty has largely endured, serving as a key example of successful transboundary water management. It also outlines mechanisms for cooperation, data sharing, and conflict resolution related to water use.

        <h2>Why it is important today?</h2>
        <br>
        After the Phalgam terrorist attacks, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty. This compromised the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, which support tens of millions of people, and 80% of Pakistan‚Äôs water comes from rivers under the treaty. The agriculture sector in Pakistan will also be affected as it relies on that water for irrigation and drinking. The agriculture sector comprises 23% of Pakistan‚Äôs economy, and 68% rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.
